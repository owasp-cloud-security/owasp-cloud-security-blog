# OWASP Cloud Security

We believe that cyber security has a fundamental role to play in protecting the digital future. We also believe that cyber security isn't just about the technology; it's about the people. The customer, the developer, the designer, the security engineer, even the attacker. Not only is cyber security a never-ending process, it's also a conversation.

This project was created to enable that conversation, helping people secure their products and services running in the cloud by providing a set of easy to use threat and control stories that pool together the expertise and experience of the development, operations, and security communities.
