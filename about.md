# OWASP Cloud Security

We believe that cyber security has a fundamental role to play in protecting the digital future. We also believe that cyber security isn't just about the technology; it's about the people. The customer, the developer, the designer, the security engineer, even the attacker. Not only is cyber security a never-ending process, it's also a conversation.

This project was created to enable that conversation, helping people secure their products and services running in the cloud by providing a set of easy to use threat and control stories that pool together the expertise and experience of the development, operations, and security communities.

## Using the blog

### Publishing a blog post

Each blog post must be in the `/_posts` folder and be in the format: `2018-1-1-Hello-World.md`

The file format is markdown so this [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md
